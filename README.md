#### Branching strategy
- `main` 
1. This is production branch. Never touch it or there will be terrible consequences.:)
2. We will only merge dev rom into main branch
- `dev`
1. Always take feature branch from dev branch and merge it in this branch.
2. This branch will also be deployed for testing purposes.
- `####-<feature-info>`
1. '####' = Ticket/Card number. Properly describe the feature that you are working on.
2. Once approved. This branch will be merged into dev branch.

#### Commit strategy
- `git commit -m '####-<meaningful-commit>`
1. '####' = Ticket/Card number. Properly describe the feature on which you worked through meaningful commit message.
2. Writing bad commit comments will have dangerous consequences. ðŸ˜ˆ
